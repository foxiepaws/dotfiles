* Allie's dotfiles

  contains most all of my dotfiles that are worth sharing.

** emacs
   my main editor.
** vim
   I still use vim occasionally, it starts up a lot faster than emacs
   which is important for when i'm doing quick stuff
** zsh
   I use ZSH as my main shell. both .zshrc and .zprofile are included
** conky
*** dwm-statusbar
    A conkyrc and a lua lib for colourising. lua code for temps is not
    portable at all (works on my FreeBSD 10.1 laptop)! Written for
    [[https://github.com/foxiepaws/dwm-fox][dwm-fox]] with pango support (watch the repo for when it hits!) 
** X related
*** xinitrc/xsession
    starts dwm, compton, and various other things, pretty boring.
*** Xresources
    Xft and urxvt tweaks
** walls.pl
   Config file for my wallpaper changer [[http://github.com/foxiepaws/walls.pl][Which can be found here]]
